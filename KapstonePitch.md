* What problem are you solving?
    * It’s always difficult to find the right doctor. There’s not one central location where you can browse different doctors in your location. At the same time if you find a doctor you have to make sure that they’re on your insurance or within your price range. You also have to determine if they’re the right type of doctor, equipped to decipher and treat your ailments.
    * Hospitals are incredibly unorganized and prone to miscommunicate. Often the patience information will be spread out between different doctors and hospitals and the patient will be asked the same questions over and over again, having to reiterate to doctors and nurses each their symptoms, medications and conditions.
* What is your Solution? 
    * This app will eliminate these problems by doing all the work for you. It will have a database of all the doctors that are in your location. You will simply have to put in your insurance or set a specific price range and it will provide you with a list of doctors that fit the parameters. In the same fashion you will also put in your symptoms and the app will match your symptoms with a doctor who will be capable of dealing with those symptoms.
    * On the app you will be able to keep all your medical information in one file. Your medications, appointment dates, symptoms, conditions, etc. When ever necessary you will have the option to give any doctor or nurse access to this information. Keeping all your info in one location will help speed up the process of meeting with a doctor and help the patient / doctor keep track of the patience health.
